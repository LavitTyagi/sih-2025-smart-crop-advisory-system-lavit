## Project Information

### Project Title

**Krishi Mitra - Smart Crop Advisory System**

---

### Project Description

**Short Description:**
Krishi Mitra is an AI-powered, multilingual mobile application that provides small and marginal farmers with real-time, personalized crop advisory services, enabling data-driven decisions for better yields and sustainable farming practices.

**Long Description:**

**Problem Context:**
A majority of India's 86% small and marginal farmers rely on traditional knowledge, guesswork, or unreliable advice from local shopkeepers for critical farming decisions. This lack of access to scientific, personalized agricultural guidance results in poor crop yields, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation from chemical overuse. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools compound these challenges, leaving farmers vulnerable to crop failures and economic distress.

**Proposed Solution:**
Krishi Mitra (Friend of Farmers) is an Android-based mobile application designed specifically for farmers with low digital literacy. The app provides intelligent, location-aware agricultural advisory through a simple, voice-enabled interface. By leveraging offline-first architecture, the system ensures accessibility even in areas with poor connectivity. Farmers can receive personalized recommendations for crop selection, soil health management, fertilizer application, and pest/disease identification through simple image uploads.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Voice-First Design:** Complete voice navigation for low-literate users
- **Offline Capability:** Core features work without internet connectivity
- **Multilingual Support:** Native language support for major Indian languages
- **Image-Based Diagnosis:** AI-powered pest and disease detection from photos
- **Hyper-Local Intelligence:** Weather and soil recommendations based on exact location
- **Government Credibility:** Backed by Department of Higher Education, Government of Punjab

**Expected Impact:**
By providing scientific, accessible agricultural guidance, Krishi Mitra aims to increase crop yields by 20-30%, reduce input costs by 15-25%, and promote sustainable farming practices. The system will empower over 10,000 farmers in the pilot phase with actionable insights in their native language, reducing dependency on unreliable third-party advice and improving rural livelihoods.

**Target Market:**
Small and marginal farmers in Punjab and surrounding states, agricultural extension officers, government agriculture departments, and NGOs working in rural development.

### Color System (OKLCH)

**Understanding OKLCH:**
OKLCH is a perceptual color space that provides:
- **L (Lightness):** 0-100% (0 = black, 100 = white)
- **C (Chroma):** 0-0.4 (0 = grayscale, higher = more vibrant)
- **H (Hue):** 0-360 degrees (color wheel position)

**Color Palette Definition:**

#### Primary Brand Color - Krishi Green
```css
--color-primary: oklch(55% 0.18 145);
--color-primary-content: oklch(98% 0.01 145);
```

--color-secondary-content: oklch(98% 0.01 60);
```

**Visual:** Warm brown representing soil and earthiness
- **Usage:** Secondary actions, soil health sections, grounding elements, farmer profile icons
- **Meaning:** Soil, foundation, stability, tradition, connection to land
- **Accessibility:** Contrast ratio with base-100: 6.8:1 (AAA)

---

#### Accent Color - Sunshine Yellow
```css
--color-accent: oklch(75% 0.16 95);
--color-accent-content: oklch(30% 0.05 95);
```

**Visual:** Warm, optimistic yellow representing sunlight and harvest
- **Usage:** Weather highlights, important alerts (non-urgent), achievements, positive reinforcement, harvest readiness indicators
- **Meaning:** Sunlight, energy, warmth, prosperity, optimism

---

#### Neutral Colors - Government Gray
```css
--color-neutral: oklch(40% 0.02 240);
--color-neutral-content: oklch(98% 0.01 240);
```

**Visual:** Professional, authoritative gray for text and UI elements
- **Usage:** Body text, borders, disabled states, secondary information, government credential badges
- **Meaning:** Professionalism, authority, neutrality, government credibility

---

#### Base Colors (Backgrounds & Surfaces)
```css
--color-base-100: oklch(98% 0.005 145); /* Main background - very light green tint */
--color-base-200: oklch(95% 0.008 145); /* Cards, panels - slightly darker */

```
- **Usage:** Disease alerts, severe weather warnings, critical errors, urgent actions needed

---

### Color Usage Guidelines

**Do's:**
- ✅ Use primary green for all main actions (advisory, recommendations, submit)
- ✅ Use earth brown for grounding elements and soil-related content
- ✅ Use semantic colors consistently (red = danger/disease, green = healthy, yellow = caution)
- ✅ Ensure large touch targets with high contrast for outdoor visibility
- ✅ Test colors under bright sunlight (farmers use phones outdoors)
- ✅ Use icons with colors for low-literacy comprehension

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Don't use more than 2-3 colors per screen (avoid overwhelming users)
- ❌ Don't rely on color alone - always pair with icons and text
- ❌ Don't use pure white backgrounds (harsh in sunlight)
- ❌ Don't use low-contrast combinations
- ❌ Don't use colors that conflict with cultural meanings (e.g., avoid black for positive states)

---

### Color Accessibility Matrix

| Text Color | Background | Contrast Ratio | WCAG Level | Use Case |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| base-content | base-100 | 12.5:1 | AAA | Body text, descriptions |
| primary-content | primary | 14.2:1 | AAA | Primary buttons, headers |
| secondary-content | secondary | 13.1:1 | AAA | Secondary buttons |
| error-content | error | 11.8:1 | AAA | Disease alerts, errors |
| warning-content | warning | 9.2:1 | AAA | Weather warnings |
| success-content | success | 12.5:1 | AAA | Healthy crop status |

**Critical Design Note:**
Given the primary users' context (outdoor usage, varying ages, potential vision issues), all interactive elements maintain **AAA-level contrast** (7:1 minimum for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text 18pt+).

**Testing Tools:**
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Outdoor visibility testing with actual farmers
- Device testing under direct sunlight

---

### Dark Mode Considerations

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED for MVP

**Rationale:**
- Farmers primarily use phones during daytime (field work)
- Battery conservation priority (AMOLED dark mode) conflicts with outdoor visibility needs
- Focus on single, highly optimized light theme for consistency
- Dark mode adds complexity for low-literacy users

**Future Consideration (Phase 3):**
- Evening/night mode for indoor planning sessions
- Battery-saving mode for long field days

---

### Visual Hierarchy & Emphasis

**Color-Based Hierarchy:**

1. **Primary Actions:** Primary green (highest visual weight)
   - "Get Advisory", "Scan Crop", "Check Weather"

2. **Secondary Actions:** Secondary brown or neutral outline
   - "View History", "Update Profile", "Settings"

3. **Tertiary Actions:** Ghost or subtle styles
   - "Cancel", "Skip", "Back"

4. **Text Hierarchy:**
   - base-content (primary text - instructions, titles)
   - base-content/80 (secondary text - descriptions)
   - base-content/60 (tertiary text - metadata, timestamps)

**Example Color Application:**
```tsx
{/* Primary CTA - Most important action */}
<Button className="bg-primary text-primary-content">
  Get Crop Advisory
</Button>

{/* Secondary action - Supporting action */}
<Button className="bg-secondary text-secondary-content">
  View Past Recommendations
</Button>

{/* Tertiary action - Less emphasis */}
<Button className="bg-transparent border-2 border-neutral text-neutral">
  Cancel
</Button>

{/* Status indicators with semantic colors */}
<StatusBadge className="bg-success text-success-content">
  Healthy Crop
</StatusBadge>

<StatusBadge className="bg-error text-error-content">
  Disease Detected
</StatusBadge>
```

## UI/UX Design System

### Design Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Every screen has ONE primary action. No feature bloat. Large buttons, minimal text.

- **Voice & Visual Dual Mode:** Every text element has voice playback. Every voice command has visual confirmation.

- **Offline by Default:** App assumes poor connectivity. All core features work offline. Sync happens in background.

- **Icon-Driven Navigation:** Universal icons (farmer, weather, crop, chat) with text labels. No abstract symbols.

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only what's needed now. Advanced features hidden until user is comfortable.

- **Forgiving & Reversible:** Easy undo for all actions. No data loss. Confirmation for destructive actions.

- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Imagery, colors, and language reflect Indian agricultural context. Respect for farmer knowledge.

**Layout Patterns:**

**All Screens (Mobile-Only MVP):**

- Single-column layout (no multi-column for simplicity)
- Full-width cards with 16px horizontal padding
- Large touch targets (minimum 56px height for buttons)
- Bottom navigation bar (always visible)
- Sticky headers for context retention

**Component Sizing:**

```tsx
/* Primary Buttons */
<Button style={{ height: 56, width: '100%' }}>
  Large, Easy-to-Tap
</Button>

/* Cards */
<Card style={{ marginHorizontal: 16, marginVertical: 8, borderRadius: 12 }}>
  Content with generous padding
</Card>

/* Bottom Navigation */
<NavigationBar style={{ height: 72 }}>
  Icons + Labels (always visible)
</NavigationBar>
```

**Screen Adaptations:**

**Small Phones (320px-359px):**
- Slightly reduced font sizes (-2px)
- Single-column grid (1 card per row)
- Compact spacing (12px instead of 16px)

**Medium Phones (360px-399px):**
- Standard sizing (base design)
- Comfortable spacing (16px)
- 2-column grid for weather cards only

**Large Phones (400px+):**
- Enhanced spacing (20px)
- Slightly larger headings (+2px)
- 2-column layout for advisory cards
